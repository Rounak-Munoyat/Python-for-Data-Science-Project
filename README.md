# Uber Drive Analysis
The project is based on the trips made by Uber drivers. Here, we analyzed different aspects of the trips by doing Exploratory Data Analysis.

1) Firstly, we checked the first & last 10 rows, also found the dimensions & total number of elements in the dataset.
2) Also, understood the datatypes of each columns and found the number of missing values in each of those.
3) Then, created a table of summary for numerical variables.
4) Removed the missing values from the dataset & stored it in a new dataframe.
5) Identified the unique values of starting and stopping locoations of rides.
6) Displayed all rides which started from San Francisco.
7) Identified that 'Cary' was the most frequent starting and stopping point of all rides.
8) Identified that 'Cary' to 'Morrisville' was the most frequent route of all rides.
9) Total Miles travelled is the highest for 'Meeting' Purpose.
10) Number of rides for 'Business' purpose is significiantly higher that 'Personal' purpose.
